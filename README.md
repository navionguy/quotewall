# Welcome to the Quote Wall!

A web app for logging and presenting quotes collected from my days in the software industry.
Okay, it really was just an exercise in learning the Buffalo suite.

## What is Buffalo?

Buffalo is a "web development eco system for Go".  To learn more, surf on over to [http://gobuffalo.io](http://gobuffalo.io) and reviewing the documentation there.

## My Motivation

I hate doing UI work, always have.  Anything that makes that work easier and lets me spend my time thinking about the back-end is something I want to understand.

The whole "collecting quotes" started as a way to keep myself entertained during long meetings.  If you listen to a meeting with the right from of mind, or maybe 
just a twisted sense of humor.  You will hear some really memorable things.

The original "wall" was just that, the outside wall of my cubicle.  After many years of posting printed pieces of paper on the wall at work my employer foolishly
gave me access to some display screens in the engineering department.  In addition to showing project status reports and release schedules I would sneak in the 
occasional random quote.

Somebody once pointed out to me that a lot of the quotes I posted were taken out of context.  But that was the whole point!

## Why did I recreate the wall with Buffalo?

Last year my employer, let's call them "Big Inc.", decided that our group was small enough to shut down.  Fortunately, I was able to save over two thousand quotes
recorded over the years.  They are safely saved away in my GitHub account.

## The Wall in Action

As soon as I get some security baked into the code, I'm going to setup a server on the web and get the Cloud Wall back in operation.
